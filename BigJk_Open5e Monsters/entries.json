Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.","name":"Variant: Genie Powers"}],"speed":{"fly":60,"walk":40},"spell_list":["https://api.open5e.com/spells/detect-magic/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/enlargereduce/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/tongues/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/conjure-elemental/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/gaseous-form/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/invisibility/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/major-image/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/plane-shift/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/wall-of-fire/"],"strength":22,"strength_save":null,"subtype":"","type":"elemental","wisdom":15,"wisdom_save":6}},{"id":"open5e/einherjar","name":"Einherjar","data":{"actions":[{"desc":"An einherjar makes three attacks with its Asgardian battleaxe or one with its handaxe.","name":"Multiattack"},{"attack_bonus":9,"damage_dice":"2d8","desc":"Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.","name":"Hag Coven"},{"desc":"While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n• 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n• 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n• 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n• 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n• 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n• 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.","name":"Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)"},{"desc":"A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.","name":"Hag Eye (Coven Only)"}],"speed":{"swim":40,"walk":30},"spell_list":["https://api.open5e.com/spells/identify/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/ray-of-sickness/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/hold-person/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/locate-object/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/bestow-curse/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/counterspell/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/lightning-bolt/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/phantasmal-killer/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/polymorph/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/contact-other-plane/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/scrying/","https://api.open5e.com/spells/eye-bite/"],"strength":16,"strength_save":null,"subtype":"","type":"fey","wisdom":12,"wisdom_save":null}},{"id":"open5e/sea-horse","name":"Sea Horse","data":{"actions":"","alignment":"unaligned","armor_class":11,"armor_desc":null,"challenge_rating":"0","charisma":2,"charisma_save":null,"condition_immunities":"","constitution":8,"constitution_save":null,"damage_immunities":"","damage_resistances":"","damage_vulnerabilities":"","dexterity":12,"dexterity_save":null,"document__license_url":"http://open5e.com/legal","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"Systems Reference Document","group":null,"hit_dice":"1d4","hit_points":1,"img_main":null,"intelligence":1,"intelligence_save":null,"languages":"","legendary_actions":"","legendary_desc":"","name":"Sea Horse","perception":null,"reactions":"","senses":"passive Perception 10","size":"Tiny","skills":{},"slug":"sea-horse","special_abilities":[{"desc":"The sea horse can breathe only underwater.","name":"Water Breathing"}],"speed":{"swim":20},"spell_list":[],"strength":1,"strength_save":null,"subtype":"","type":"beast","wisdom":10,"wisdom_save":null}},{"id":"open5e/selang","name":"Selang","data":{"actions":[{"desc":"The selang makes two dagger attacks or two short bow attacks.","name":"Multiattack"},{"attack_bonus":6,"damage_dice":"1d4","desc":"Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.
